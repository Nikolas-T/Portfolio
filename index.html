                BooksVsMovies is powered by the OpenLibrary Api and TheMovieDB. The OpenLibrary Api was used to get the
                title info, the author, the published date, and the cover for all the books searched. TheMovieDB was
                used to get the title info, the release date, and the poster for all the movies searched. The styling
                was done with Css, Bulma, Font-Awesome, as well as Adobe Illustrator. BooksVsMovies uses the jquery
                library for the javascript.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
